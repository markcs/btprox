32feet.NET Personal Area Networking for .NET v2.2
Build 2.2.1115 15th November 2007

This library provides a .NET networking API for devices and desktop computers running the Microsoft Bluetooth stack, Microsoft Windows supported IrDA devices and associated Object Exchange (OBEX) services for both these mediums. Online documentation is integrated into your Visual Studio help. The object model has been designed to promote consistency between Bluetooth, IrDA and traditional TCP/IP networking.

Supported Platforms
* .NET Framework v2.0 / v3.0 / v3.5
* .NET Compact Framework v1.0 / v2.0 / v3.5
* Windows XP SP1 and above
* Windows Vista
* Windows CE 4.2 and above
* Windows Mobile 2003 and above
* Only the Microsoft Bluetooth stack is supported - this library will not work with Broadcom and other third-party stacks.

Tools
Requires Visual Studio 2005.

Samples
BluetoothChat - Multiplatform chat application, versions for Smartphone, Pocket PC and Desktop
BluetoothRemote - Desktop listener and Smartphone client, forwards button presses to the desktop, can be used to remotely control Powerpoint etc
BluetoothSDP –Showcases SDP parsing.
ObexPush - Used to send any file object to an available device over Bluetooth or IrDA
ObjectPushVB – Visual Basic device project (VS2003)
DesktopObexListener - Listens for and stores incoming objects (Designed for use on a Windows XP machine)
DeviceObexListener – Pocket PC equivalent (Turn off default Beam option on device for this to run)
IrDAServiceClient – Shows the IrDA functionality available for desktop Windows

V2.2.1115
* SDP record parsing
* Blocked .NETCF assembly from running on desktop
* Bug fixes – See Codeplex workspace for history
* Improved RSSI property
V2.1.0207
* Unit Tests added
* Bug Fixes – See Codeplex Workspace for history
* Added options to SelectBluetoothDeviceDialog
* Clearer identification of assemblies from their file resources
* Limited SDP support with BluetoothDeviceInfo and ServiceRecord types
* Support for changes in Windows Mobile 5.0 AKU3 Registry
* RSSI support for devices supporting this feature
* More optimization in the platform/framework specific builds

V2.0.60828
* Merged into single assembly – InTheHand.Net.Personal.dll
* Separate builds for device/desktop (work around VB.NET desktop compiler bug)
* Improved ClassOfDevice handling
* Improved BluetoothSecurity.PairDevice on Windows CE
* Improved BluetoothRadio.IsSupported on Windows CE
* Performance improvements and added code comments

v1.6.51222
* Fixed a bug in IrDAAddress.Equals
* Added new InTheHand.Net.Bluetooth.Manufacturer constants
v1.6.51212
* Added compatibility with VS2005 RTM and simplified installer
* Libraries now added to “Add Reference” list on desktop projects
* BluetoothDeviceInfo.SetServiceState allows you to install/remove drivers for services on devices such as Serial port etc (Windows XP only)
* Fixed BluetoothRadio.IsSupported on Windows XP machines
* Improved ObexListener code to reduce instances of OBEX parsing failure
* BluetoothSecurity PairRequest / RemoteDevice support for both CE and XP
* Moved Forms functionality to InTheHand.Net.Forms.dll
* Improved IrDAClient.DiscoverDevices to discover multiple devices and handle different character encodings. Added more IrDADeviceHints
* Documentation fixes

v1.5.51015
* Improvements to OBEX code to provide added support for the ContentLength header
* Improved handling of interrupted links during OBEX transfer
* Added SocketOptionName constants for IrDA library
* Improvements to ObexListener buffer handling and speed

v1.5.50922
* Changed BluetoothRadio to correctly distinguish between a radio which is turned off or not present
* Altered ObexListener SDP record to improve compatibility with more device types

v1.5.50920
* This release further improves the consistency with other Sockets based classes within .NET. Both BluetoothClient and BluetoothListener publicly expose their Client and Server Sockets respectively along with additional relevant properties as found on the TcpClient class.
* The BluetoothDeviceInfo class is enhanced to provide more information about remote devices. BluetoothRadio provides new properties to make it easier to determine if the platform supports the library.
* A bug was fixed in the BluetoothRemoteListener sample where the listener would lock up following a disconnect.
* Basic service discovery is supported on Windows XP via the Services property on BluetoothDeviceInfo, under Windows CE this always returns an empty collection.
